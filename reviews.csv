	359philip	1	1	Vritomartis hotel Crete	Reviewed 16 June 2015	"When we arrived at Vritomartis towards the end of May 2015,  tired after a long journey from England, we were immediately impressed by the friendly welcome we were given. After checking in and having been given essential imformation, we were shown to our bungalow room. This was very pleasant and clean, with a fine view over the sea to the island of Gavdos. Cleaniliness is a priority at Vritomartis: all parts of the hotel and grounds are kept scrupulously clean, and the rooms are attended to punctiliously every day.
The food is very good. At breakfast there is a wide choice of bread, cheeses, meats, salads, fruit, omelette, bacon, fried and boiled eggs, fruit juices, and coffee. Lunch in the shade by the swimming pool is most pleasant; again a wide choice of food, and excellent beer. At dinner there is a wide choice of salads, soup, vegetables, three different main courses, cakes, and fruits. Cretan wine is delightful. The bar is well stocked, and the prices are impressively low.
Vritomartis is an excellent place to come to for a week, especially when one is stressed and exhausted. It is most relaxing to lie by the pool, swim if you must, and read. The beach is fifteen minutes away on foot; there is a small bus run by the hotel for those who don't fancy the walk. The water is clear,and the small bay good for swimming.

The hotel sends a small bus down several times a day to bring guests back.All the staff at Vritomartis are friendly and helpful, and speak very good English. It seems as though they cannot do enough to ensure that guests have a first-class stay. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and wished we had booked for longer. We hope to return next year.More"	5	280566859	May-15	Oxfordshire, United Kingdom

	John J	6	8	Close to perfection	Reviewed 15 June 2015	We were welcomed from the moment we entered the door by a very friendly happy staff and from then on it was all as it says on the web site and in the 5 star reviews. .  In particular we loved the spacious and peaceful environment around the hotel pool and at the beach. But the whole resort operation was very efficient, taxi service, beach bar, pool bar, trips etc. and the inevitable result was a perfect holiday. The holiday exceeded our expectations and we also will be back next year.	5	280292028	May-15	United Kingdom

	Olwyn H	100	32	ultimate relaxation	Reviewed 3 June 2015	What more can one ask, sun, excellent hotel, and wonderful location. Once again we found ourselves back at Vritomartis. We still find new places to visit but the highlight is the pleasure of good company while relaxing in the Cretan sun by the pool or on the beach. We meet old friends and make new ones each year. The new facelift has made the hotel even more attractive if that is possible . The upgraded dining room is brilliant and the food is even better than before.  "I'll be back!" is the unfailing comment from all first time visitors . Just leave some room for me, as I will be back next year too.	5	277503351	Apr-15	Ipswich, United Kingdom

	BartDB	33	18	Wonderful resort, great hospitality!	Reviewed 13 March 2015	Vritomartis is a resort where the Greek hospitality has been reinvented and has become even greater than it is elsewhere! Every guest is really welcome here, one takes the trouble to get to know the guests personally and shows lots of respect. These naturist accommodation is neat and spacious, the food is delicious. The pool is great, the beach within walking distance of the hotel idyllic. And for those who find it too hot or difficult to walk, a shuttle bus drives up and down. The entertainment: something for everyone and for those who don't need or like entertainment: the place is also fine as 'do nothing' location! A fantastic place to relax, we will definitely return!	5	259257997	Aug-14

	Taffandwife	2	12	Brilliant haven of peace and freedom	Reviewed 29 December 2014	My husband and I stayed here in September 2014 and we have just booked to go again next year. It is a warm, friendly and peaceful resort and we cannot rate it highly enough. The food was lovely and plenty of it as well as a different choice every evening. We met some wonderful people and we are booking the same time as some of them to meet up again. There is entertainment in the evenings and the bar is open until the last customer leaves. The staff are so friendly and efficient and put everyone at their ease. The guests' comfort and enjoyment is their priority. The pool is fab - however we tended to use the wonderful beach. TIP - take beach shoes. We are looking forward to returning next year and cannot recommend Vritomartis highly enough. We love it there.	5	246317555	Sep-14	Paphos District, Cyprus
	PalomaGe	27	25	Heaven on earth	Reviewed 25 December 2014	I stayed at Vritomartis in July 2012 with friends. I'd never heard of such a place before and I must admit I was reluctant at first. Upon arrival I was thoroughly explained how the resort works and was given my room (no wait). I'd like to have a double bed in my single reservation but I still liked it with the complimentary toiletries and traditional covers. The place is easy to reach with a frequent shuttle to the nearby town. The location is idyllic and the scenery very well planned and maintained, always spotless. The food was also very good, both breakfast and dinner. Staff was very polite and discreet always catering for every need. The facilities and activities during the day make stay there very pleasant. The private beach is also beautiful only a few minutes walk with a mini bar should we need anything. I'd love to visit again for longer this time as I liked the quality of people some of whom we're friends with now. Definitely recommend it and I can't make any suggestions for improvements.	5	245802314	Jul-14	Brighton and Hove, United Kingdom
	Simca1301	233	106	Brilliant	Reviewed 26 November 2014	Totally relaxing, the hotel rooms, the beach, although a bit stoney.The staff are great, very helpful and friendly.Lots to do (if you want to), no pressure in joining in or not, I played boules, archery and volley ball and just chilled.I didn't go on any trips but maybe next time as I will return.	4	241601964	Oct-14	Manchester
	FamilyofFourplus	1	7	Totally chilled	Reviewed 23 November 2014	We have family holidayed every year in La Jenny in France (also a great place to stay) and every day is busy with family activities, but decided to go for a slower paced holiday this year as kids are now a lot older. Vritomartis is an absolute treasure and a major find for us, helped a lot by other Trip Advisor reviews. We arrived at Chandia airport at midnight and the taxi , organised by the hotel, was waiting for us. Its a long winding trip across Crete and we got to the Hotel at 2 am, to be greeted by a "midnight feast" laid on for us. This is one of the best late night welcomes I have ever experienced. The rooms are very comfortable with air conditioning, the food is fantastic and plentiful and the hotel treats its guests with respect and courtesy. Most evenings had entertainment in the warm Crete evenings. During the day, we laid in the sun and chilled with the occasional dip in the pool. We ventured out to the local village using the complimentary hotel bus and to the nearby beach also via the bus. Twice, we walked. The village, Chora Svaklion has boats that can take you to nearby beaches, scuba diving and restaurants for lunch. We also had a organised trip that took us to three local villages. In summary, a perfect holiday and we will be going there again.	5	241091483	Aug-14	High Wycombe, United Kingdom
	clemetina23	7	6	Heaven on earth!	Reviewed 7 November 2014	Our second visit and needing to relax we made sure we had booked for two weeks. Each day we walked down to the private beach and swam in the warm sea and lunched at the excellent beach cafe/bar. Remember your beach shoes for the pebbles. We could have lazed by the hotel pool.The hotel is perfect -  the accommodation has been upgraded since our last visit, the staff were as helpful as ever and the food still very good. Eating dinner outside is an option.  We were too lazy to take part in the range of walks and boat trips that are well organised.  I did play tennis, did yoga and walked to the local village getting the hotel bus back. In the evenings there were a variety of events e.g.greek dancing, a quiz etc. Wonderful sunsets.A really international range of clients to enjoy talking with.	5	238644781	Oct-14	salisbury

The garden is superb, the nudist beach is perfect, the restaurant offers fantastic, delicious breakfast and dinner every day, with a good choice of international and local dishes. You can find good food also at the pool bar and at the beach taverna.During the evenings you can relax and spend some beautiful hours together with other guests at the bar.When we think to relax, fantastic sea, beautiful landscape, etc. Vritomartis is always our first choice.Crete is a fantastic island and the region of Sfakia is absolutely our favourite one. We miss our paradise and we hope to come back soon......Thank you very much for the fantastic welcome, we wish you all a good winter.Sabina&Fulvio	5	238600116	Oct-14	Ravenna, Italy

After checking in and having been given essential imformation, we were shown to our bungalow room. This was very pleasant and clean, with a fine view over the sea to the island of Gavdos. Cleaniliness is a priority at Vritomartis: all parts of the hotel and grounds are kept scrupulously clean, and the rooms are attended to punctiliously every day.
The food is very good. At breakfast there is a wide choice of bread, cheeses, meats, salads, fruit, omelette, bacon, fried and boiled eggs, fruit juices, and coffee. Lunch in the shade by the swimming pool is most pleasant; again a wide choice of food, and excellent beer. At dinner there is a wide choice of salads, soup, vegetables, three different main courses, cakes, and fruits. Cretan wine is delightful. The bar is well stocked, and the prices are impressively low.
Vritomartis is an excellent place to come to for a week, especially when one is stressed and exhausted. It is most relaxing to lie by the pool, swim if you must, and read.

	Dona C	3	6	A perfect 4 days!	Reviewed 25 October 2014	We only scheduled four days at the resort, but each was perfect in its own way.Day 1 Check-in, unwind, relax, meet a fabulous couple from Canada, swim, dinner, dancing!Day 2 Breakfast, a windy but sunny day on lovely Filaki beach, a long nap, dinner, early nightDay 3 Breakfast, a fabulous car trip with new friends north and east of the resort, Greek lesson, dinner, music in the barDay 4 Breakfast, a tour of three naturist friendly beaches, lunch at Loutro, dress for dinner and dancingDay 5 Breakfast, pack up, check out and a free shuttle back to  Sfakia with a complimentary bottle of olive oil in my bag. All this with a staff who could not have been more courteous and helpful. When we checked in, I asked if we could be moved to a room with a double bed rather than two twins pushed together. Nothing was available, but the receptionist told me someone would come and fix the beds. Within minutes, staff arrived with a foam rubber space filler, a memory foam bed topper, and king size sheets. I'll bet we had the most comfortable bed in the resort. That experience seemed to set the standard for the service we had over our entire stay. I'm already working on the calendar for next year. We will return!	5	236173304	Oct-14	Parras de la Fuente, Coahuila de Zaragoza, Mexico

Reviewed 21 October 2014	This was our first visit to Vritomartis.It will not be our last.From the moment you arrive you are made to feel like part of the family,not only by the superb staff,but by the other guests.The cleanliness of the rooms and outside areas was excellent, a testament to all the cleaning staff who were quick to greet you with "Kali-mera" every morning.Whether you were sunning yourself around the lovely pool area,or down on the private beach you were able to relax completely.There were numerous organized trips to go on,although we didn't go on any of them this time round.There were also activities such as volleyball,water polo and archery organized.However you were never put under any pressure to take part.Did try archery for the first time though.Meals at both breakfast and dinner were very good,with multiple choices to cater for all the different nationalities there.We will definitely be returning next year with a view to trying some of the naturist boat trips.We can honestly say that our stay at Vritommartis has been the most relaxing holiday we have ever had.Can't wait to go back.	5	235511940	Oct-14	Leicester, United Kingdom

	Oskar1501	15	18	Top secret	Reviewed 7 October 2014	What a lovely place, the staff are the best you will find anywhere in the world, nothing is a problem. The hotel is spotlessly clean as are the rooms, the gardens and pool. The food is excellent for the format they use and coffee is top quality. The beach is secluded but the stones and rocks as you enter are not so clever especially if you have mobility problems and you pay for the sun beds which must rank as the most uncomfortable. Beds at the pool are far better. Your danglies are safe from the cats which are a mother and kittens who are friendly and pleasure to watch playing in the sun, after all it is Crete and there wasn't a mouse or rat to be seen which given the isolated setting and food waste, is no bad thing. Have booked to return next year before leaving, so the review is genuine, it really is the most relaxing place but don't tell your friends, it's hard enough to get a room now as it is!!!Thank you to all the staff at every level who make this such as special place.	5	232988136	Oct-14	London, United Kingdom
	NatTourist	4	45	Wonderful holiday with the Vritomartis 'family'	Reviewed 6 October 2014	I have recently returned from a wonderful holiday with â€˜friends and familyâ€™ and yet I travelled by myself! This was my third visit to Vritomartis (see previous reviews for details) and it was made all the more enjoyable by seeing many people, both staff and guests, whom Iâ€™d met on my previous visits: I once again felt part of the Vritomartis family. There were also several new members of staff this year but the sentiment remains the same: they are all very welcoming and go out of their way to make sure you have the best holiday ever.This year, many of the UK flight times were later in the day and I arrived into Chania Airport just after 18:30. My taxi, arranged in advance through the hotel, was waiting for me and shortly before 20:00 I arrived in Reception for the customary welcome. My arrival was in the middle of dinner so I went to my room, dropped off my bags, then returned to the restaurant (where I was immediately welcomed by several familiar staff) for the first of many enjoyable meals. I relish the wonderful and varied food on offer and the buffet style means I can try a little of several dishes each time.In my bungalow, there were a couple of obvious improvements this year: firstly, the bathrooms have been completely refurnished with a walk-in shower replacing the shower-bath; secondly, there is a safe in the room, not that I have ever had any concerns with security. As usual, my room, along with the rest of the hotel and grounds, were kept immaculately clean throughout my stay.When I stay at Vritomartis, I like to balance my time between relaxation, either at the beach or by the pool, and taking part in many of the excursions and activities on offer. I enjoy walking and once again went on all of the gorge walks: Aradena is a mildly challenging but beautiful gorge that finishes at the taverna overlooking the glorious Marmara beach; Imbros is the easiest gorge, nearest to the hotel; and Ilingas gorge (jeep safari) lies in between and the majority of the walk is optionally naturist. The jeep safari ends with a scrumptious traditional Cretan lunch in Anopoli, accompanied by plenty of raki, and I enjoy the trip so much that, for the second year running, I went on it twice! I also took part in more activities at the hotel this year, including boules, archery, volleyball, aqua-gym, shuffleboard, tennis and pool. These are all entirely optional but provide a great opportunity to meet other guests.After two glorious weeks, my holiday at Vritomartis came to an end and I was heading back to the airport with more fond memories. Iâ€™ll definitely be returning so, until next year, au revoir!	5	232952132	Sep-14	Bath, United Kingdom
	Paul_Zjuzdme	1	1	Staying at Vritomartis	Reviewed 4 October 2014	I needed to get away from 'it all' and desperately wanted sunshine on my skin so I looked for a naturist place on one of the best Greek islands. I found Vritomartis and booked a stay for a week. I now know that a week was not enough.Vritomartis is a place to wind down, to find yourself, meet nice people and be entirely carefree while the incredibly nice staff there tries to make everything as perfect for you as they can. You can do nothing, you can do little things (aqya gym, volleyball, tennis, archery, Greek lessons) or do big things (naturist boat cruises, hikes through the many gorges that are near the hotel). There is something for everyone.When you've been there once you're bound to go back for more.	5	232530458	Sep-14	Cuijk, The Netherlands
	Fly_Me_To_The_Sun	4	15	Better and better!	Reviewed 4 October 2014	We have never been to any other hotel where the staff are so helpful, friendly and discreet.  Top marks to all.  Restaurant and bar staff give the impression that they have been waiting all day just to serve YOU.Dinner was first-class, with more "Greekness" introduced alongside the wide variety of quality food available. (Try the dolmadakia!)  The cleaning staff keep the place spotless.One negative point is that this year, several cats appear to have turned up.  Their presence can be disturbing when your're trying to eat lunch, naked, at the poolside bar.  I sincerely hope they've at least been fully vaccinated.	5	232491085	Sep-14	Paris, France

The staff no matter where they originate from where always attentive and willing to have a chat. The Buffet theme changed daily, and was replenished during the evening, I could always find something I really enjoyed.We enjoyed it so much we have already booked to go back twice in 2015.	5	232283600	Sep-14	Famagusta, Cyprus

	83NickA83	197	102	Naked delight	Reviewed 29 September 2014	Just spent our honeymoon here and made some fantastic friends from all around the globe, the staff were all exceptionally caring and helpful. Rooms comfortable and kept spotlessly clean, with some great views of surrounding areas. Ample sunbeds around the pool, plenty of showers, free shuttle bus to beach which had a great taverna, lots of places to swim and snorkel.Great choice for breakfast and evening meals (included in room rate but drinks extra) once again the staff very efficient. Lots of trips organised but sadly the "main naturist day trip" was always fully booked or cancelled. A bigger boat or two boats maybe an idea?Suggest also that sun-beds at the beach should be free for hotel guests, ( it's free around the pool)However this is a superb place made better by the staff, so would definitely recommend it	4	231540882	Sep-14	Marlborough, United Kingdom
	Leonid C	9	4	Could not be better	Reviewed 26 September 2014	Over of a great expectation after reading many reviews before our arriving. Two weeks in very well organized paradise. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  Service was always personally directed.Total atmosphere of family resort. Beach Filaki could also be translated as "feel lucky". Shuttle to beach is going very accurate according schedule, but walking about 10-12 min is also not a big deal. Pool near the main building is also very convenient with a lot of free of charge beds and umbrellas. Rooms were cleaned well, beach and pool bars were very pleasant and helpful, the buffet food was very good as well. Many sports and evening entertainments, excellent guided tours. We plan to return next year.	5	231069392	Sep-14	Rehovot, HaMerkaz, Israel

	Ian C	4	3	My 2 week escape	Reviewed 23 September 2014	I had dreamt about this holiday since I booked it in November 2013; would it live up to how I imagined it? In the early hours of August 31 I was about to find out.I must say that I was not disappointed. I arrived at the resort at about 2 am and was offered a much-needed orange juice, while completing the registration form, by the friendly and helpful receptionist and was shown to my room. The room was spacious and had air conditioning and a balcony overlooking the mountains behind Chora Sfakion.A hire car is a must if you want to explore the surrounding area and beyond; the resort does offer excursions to various places and activities. I took a boat trip which visited three beaches along the south west coast and included a stop in Loutro for food and drink, there was a group of 19 people and 7 different nationalities and it was great fun.I'm not a huge fan of the buffet style when it comes to evening meals but I tried it and was pleasantly surprised by the food and the staff who were on hand to advise on which wine to have with the meal. Breakfast was good with a wide variety of food to put a breakfast together of your choice. I enjoyed my stay at Vritomartis and would recommend it to anyone looking for a holiday with a difference. Special thanks to all the staff who were helpful and charming, also thanks to the ladies who kept not only the rooms, but the whole resort clean and tidy.	5	230555056	Aug-14	Bristol, United Kingdom
	Martin H	1		Two wonderful naturist weeks	Reviewed 23 September 2014	This is our second visit, we were a little bit worried whether it would be as good as last year but it was even better - two weeks rather than one. The things that really stand out are the wonderful staff and the cleanliness. The gardens and pool area are really lovely and well maintained and having a naturist beach so close is an added treat - we love Falaki beach. You can even drive naked between hotel and beach! The room we had was clean and well appointed with a very comfortable bed. What we really appreciated is the fact that the hotel and everywhere after sunset is clothing mandatory so you get the best of both worlds, naked during the day by the pool or at the beach and dressing up for dinner. The entertainment is low key and the nearby village is quiet so it is a relaxing holiday, not a 'party' place - this suits us.Overall, we would recommend Vritormartis to anyone who wants to try a naturist resort.	5	230537546	Sep-14

	Gill C	2	1	A week in paradise	Reviewed 22 September 2014	Having read all the reviews on Trip Advisor I thought this place sounded too good to be true, but it really is excellent. This was our second visit to a complete naturist resort, we love to try different places and rarely go to the same place twice,but we'll definitely go back, rooms are simple but comfortable , bathrooms well refurbished, food plentiful and varied served outside on the terrace. The staff were wonderful, very friendly and helpful and we met some really lovely people. It was a truly relaxing,comfortable experience and we wished we'd booked for longer than a week! We loved going to the beach and having lunch at the hotel run taverna. All the staff at the hotel work so hard to make your stay enjoyable. It's a very upmarket place.	5	230376094	Sep-14	Bebington

	Robert C	3	4	Simply wonderful	Reviewed 16 September 2014	We stayed for a week but wish it could have been longer and will definitely return. From the moment you check-in the staff treat you like a long lost friend, they truly are a credit to the management team. They are all so friendly and efficient that you want for nothing.The hotel is very traditional in style and immaculately clean and well kept inside and out, there are plenty of sunbeds and the wooden type around the spacious warm pool are supremely comfortable. The food is fresh, tasty and plentiful, we tend to eat quite late and even as we were leaving at gone 9pm the chef was replenishing all the dishes. Having the beach as an option is a great addition, it's a fair walk but the shuttle bus is there if you need it, the beach bar is great for a relaxed lunch. There are plenty of sports or pastimes to occupy idle moments during the day, Eva is great at encouraging participation without being pushy, I managed to fulfill two wishes - archery and volleyball for the first time ever. Great job Vritomartis, see you all next year!	5	229250403	Sep-14	
	ionutvasilescu	93	123	Wonderfully peaceful and relaxed	Reviewed 15 September 2014	It is the first vacation in a naturist resort for me and my wife. And it was a wonderful experience.The location of the hotel â€“ although a little bit harder to access given the southern position on Crete island â€“ is excellent, remote and with a wonderful secluded pebble beach, with nice rocks and caves at the left side.The sunbeds on the beach are at an additional charge (7.5 Euros for 2 sunbeds + 1 umbrella). There is also a decent small tavern at the beach (also run by hotel personnel), and of course there is toilet and shower. The beach is only naturist, so not recommended to prudish people. One must wear adequate water shoes, in order to be able to walk on the beach and in / out of the water.The beach is not exclusively for the hotel guests. It is a public beach, so anyone can come here, although 90% of the people on the beach are hotel guests.The hotel staff is super-trooper friendly (typically for Greek people). The pool is big (at least 25 m) and I think it has heated water. There is EXCELLENT free WiFi everywhere (in the rooms, at the pool, restaurant....)!!!The food is OK. The breakfast is the English type, although not very tasty. The dinner is a buffet, and we really enjoyed it. Everything at dinner tasted very good. The dinner is from 7.00 â€“ 21.30 P.M., and the breakfast is from 7.30 â€“ 10.00 AM. Now this is the only negative side: the breakfast ends too early. The hotel is an oasis of relaxation, so a later breakfast would be much better (may 8.00-11.00....as a suggestion).The rooms are simple, but spacious enough and very clean. We stayed in a standard bungalow, with a small terrace and nice view towards the see. The gardens are very nice and well maintained. Near the pool and the pool bar there is also a small shop (mini-market), with everything one can need (from beer to souvenirs, from swimsuits to pareos....).The hotel also organizes daily trips (most of them naturist trips, on sea or on land), but we only stayed for 5 nights and we havenâ€™t been to any.The evening entertainment is acceptable but do not worry if you miss it. The Thursday night show was quite something: there was a guy who was singing live, but he really cannot sing. He is simply hurting your ears. BUT, he is a very good and funny entertainer, he sings songs from every part of the world and he has with costumes for any of these parts...The hotel also has its own olive-trees, and upon departure, they give you a complementary bottle of own olive oil. Nice...Please note the bookings should be made way in advance, as the hotel is almost always full. We were just very lucky to catch a free room because someone else had just canceled.We will definitely return here!!!	5	228948891	Sep-14	Bucharest
	pwhitmore2014	1		Another fantastic holiday	Reviewed 14 September 2014	Stayed 18/8/14 - 11/9/14  This hotel is absolutely fabulous if you just want to chill out and relax, the staff are outstanding and so friendly. This was our second time staying here and it was even better than the first. The bathrooms have recently been upgraded and are superb, beds changed every other day, clean towels as often as you want.The buffet style evening meal sometimes has a random selection, but is always very good quality, I do not envy the staff trying to cater for about 10 different nationalities !! Breakfast is brilliant absolutely anything you fancy is on offer.The pool area is beautiful and quiet, the pebble beach very relaxing.Although fairly remote, if you hire a car there are some lovely places to visit, or get the ferry from nearby Sfakia,  All in all if you want to unwind and de stress this is the place for you, cannot wait to go back again next year.Peter and Theresa Whitmore	5	228862942	Aug-14	Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom
	770pearls	7	10	Fab for first time naturists and wonderful family run hotel	Reviewed 14 September 2014	If you have toyed with going on a naturist holiday this is the hotel to visit. We arrived at close to midnight and hungry. Receptionist showed us to the outside terrace and brought us food and fruit juice. Very appreciated. Rooms spotless. We  paid extra for the sea view. Worth it but the mountain view looked pretty special too! Indoor areas are fully clothed and folk dress casually for dinner.  Private beach has lots of sun beds and shade and you can hire beds etc by the week or by the day. Sun beds and parasols by the beautiful pool are free of charge. No need for beach towels.. for 20 euro refundable deposit you can get cleans towels daily. Food very varied and tasty and typical Cretan home cooling. Greek feta and yogurt wonderful and not like the supermarket fare at home.Very hot in August but air con in room very efficient and recommend some kind of nightwear. Lots of activities on site or gorge walking trips.Beach/swimming shoes a must for going to the beach/swimming in the sea. Hotel staff very friendly. All excellent and felt like we were leaving friends behind on departure! Svetlana,  Salome and Costas Thank you. Such a difference to experience a family run hotel where customer experience truly matters. When leaving we were given a gift of the hotel's own olive oil. Will definitely go back. We made friends with other guests who I am sure we will see again. Not having been on a naturist holiday before we are now hooked!We booked independently not via a travel agent .. and the hotel arranged taxi transfers for us from and too Heraklion. If you arrive towards the evening I would not recommend negotiating the White Mountains road in the dark... taxi 1 way is 145 euros but worth it. Alternative is stay over in Heraklion and tackle the mountain roads when fresh.  Next time we may stay in the North of the island for a day or too and go see the historical ruins etc  then head to Vritomartis. Thank you to all at Vritomartis Resort.	5	228831922	Sep-14	Edinburgh, United Kingdom

	Salsacj	21	31	another great visit	Reviewed 14 September 2014	A return visit for the 2nd year and yet again a great holiday. Its as good as last year too. Chose to stay in a bungalow again and it hasn't disappointed, bathrooms have been revamped and very nice too. Staff are excellent and so friendly they are a credit to the hotel. Breakfast buffet is excellent and so much choice just like the evening buffet - your never hungry staying here :-). Beach is excellent  and so secluded and the bus is a great asset as the hill coming back can be a little steep. Only comment  would be main bar serves different beer selection to lunch bar and when evening dinning. Overall a fab place to visit and will definitely return again.	5	228815404	Sep-14	surrey

	Spink11	34	53	Excellent value and a wonderful atmosphere	Reviewed 8 September 2014	This was our first visit to Vritomartis and have come away saying it will not be the last! Staff were superb, attentive and friendly but not in your face - what an asset they are to Vritomartis. From the time you arrive you know you have struck gold.Reception helpful and knowledgeable.Room was well maintained and clean. The dinner menus were varied and meal was something to look forward to and there must surely be something that would appeal to any palate. Breakfast consisted of continental breakfast to full fry up. Swimming pool and grounds are well maintained ( I am a qualified pool plant technician and as a result am very weary about pools and their hygiene, but had no issues here and even used the pool - virtually unheard of for me...) The hotel offers a good range of in house activities and entertainment.  If you are a bit more adventurous you can also go on other walking and /or boat excursions which can be booked through he hotel.  We did three trips the jeep safari and gorge walk was by far the best followed by the Imbrose Gorge walk. The third trip a visit to a war museum and winery - the visit to the war Museum was both interesting and unique, this was the best part of the trip, we then went on to a wine tasting at the local winery, this part was a little disappointing and to be quite honest a bit over priced for what you got - this is however my opinion and wouldn't want to dissuade anyone from going on it. If you are considering going and want to go on any of the walks don't forget to take good  comfortable walking shoes/boots.	5	227744688	Aug-14	UK
	Joseph Z	16	21	Heaven on Earth	Reviewed 8 September 2014	Many people have already praised this magnificent resort so let me add just a few words. Like the sea water at the hotel beach (except one day when there was a storm) this place is pure. So clean, so friendly, so innocent. The food is good, tasty and truthful (if one can say so on food). Many products come from the nearby area. The fruits and vegetables taste like they used to when I was a child, many years ago, and not as they do now when bought at a supermarket. The rooms are clean and comfortable, and provide you with everything you need without being pompous or pretentious. The recent renovation did them good, especially when they now have a safe. The grounds are beautiful, carefully maintained by a hard working and dedicated team. Always with a smile which makes your day. I haven't seen a single employee with sour face. This is like being part of a loving, caring and sharing family. Talking about this, once again I have realised the power of family ownership (vs. hired management of a hotel chain). During the day, the owner's head will pop up at reception to see that everything is ok. And at dinner time I could see him looking around the restaurant, checking that the guests are happy and have everything that they want. In short, family ownership of a hotel is great - they care about their guests as it is their pride, and business, which is on the line.The only thing Vritomartis has to work on and improve is the internet connection. I know this is an isolated place and lightening storms sometimes cause havoc but they must have alternative systems to put in place immediately when the main one stops working. In the past thirty years I have been to many resorts, worldwide, some naturist and some not. This is no doubt the best of all of them, while at the same time being one of the least expensive. And what makes it now the number one destination for me, in addition to all the pluses I mentioned above, is the quality of the guests themselves: friendly, kind, gentle, open and willing to share their experience with others.	5	227734104	Sep-14	London, United Kingdom
	Attila D	1		Satisfaction	Reviewed 3 September 2014	The resort is great! An really nice oasis with services on most higher niveau. The kitchen is top, in ten days we havenÂ´t the same meal. I recommend the resort mainly for relax, but some outdoor activities (walk etc. ) are interesting too.	5	226571922	Aug-14	Nove Zamky, Slovakia

After checking in and having been given essential imformation, we were shown to our bungalow room. This was very pleasant and clean, with a fine view over the sea to the island of Gavdos. Cleaniliness is a priority at Vritomartis: all parts of the hotel and grounds are kept scrupulously clean, and the rooms are attended to punctiliously every day.
The food is very good. At breakfast there is a wide choice of bread, cheeses, meats, salads, fruit, omelette, bacon, fried and boiled eggs, fruit juices, and coffee. Lunch in the shade by the swimming pool is most pleasant; again a wide choice of food, and excellent beer. At dinner there is a wide choice of salads, soup, vegetables, three different main courses, cakes, and fruits. Cretan wine is delightful. The bar is well stocked, and the prices are impressively low.
Vritomartis is an excellent place to come to for a week, especially when one is stressed and exhausted. It is most relaxing to lie by the pool, swim if you must, and read. The beach is fifteen minutes away on foot; there is a small bus run by the hotel for those who don't fancy the walk. The water is clear,and the small bay good for swimming.

	Ratskrad	2		Another fantastic holiday	Reviewed 2 September 2014	Our third 2 week vacation at Vritomartis, and it just gets better each time. Nowhere else comes close for a totally relaxed break in idyllic surroundings, being looked after by fantastic staff and eating great food. This is not just a great naturist destination, it is great destination, period. Bungalows are clean and neat, the air-con works quietly and efficiently (a real plus in comparison with some places we have stayed), the beds are comfortable. Most importantly, customer service standards in all areas are superb. There are good organised trips out - we've been on a few, but the lure of long, lazy days at the beach or pool is usually too strong!	5	226488352	Aug-14	Chelmsford, United Kingdom

	Tormod E	6	12	Excellent	Reviewed 22 August 2014	This was our second visit at Vritomartis and it was even more at our satisfaction than in 2003.This place is beautyful!We lived in the main building with balcony over the restaurant, and with a nice view to the pool and ocean.Next time we will try a bungalow.We were content with most of the things; common areas, our room, the restaurant, the pool bar, the beach, the food - specially the delicious bread, cleaning, the bus service an not at least the always helpsome and smiling staff.We hope the management appreciate the skilled employees.Then the negative things; The lack of shower curtains, poor internet access and some times loud music at night and by the pool.We went to trips by ourselves to Loutro, Sweetwater Beach, Aradena Bridge, Frangokastello and Plakias.Places really worth visiting.We are looking forward to our next stay.	5	223557672	Jun-14	Askim, Norway
	SouthCoastM	64	46	First time visitors, very impressed, very relaxing.	Reviewed 20 August 2014	Having read a lot of previous reviews we really didn't have many reservations about booking Vritomartis. Arriving at Chania Airport in the early hours and driving to Sfakia was interesting to say the least and not for the faint hearted! Having said that speaking to people who transferred by taxi that is also not entirely stress-free! The remoteness is part of the appeal of this area and the hotel is a true oasis in the fairly barren landscape.We got a very warm welcome even at 2am and some food had been saved for us which was much appreciated. Our room was clean and comfortable with a modern bathroom and effective air-conditioning.Everywhere is kept very clean, all the staff work extremely hard and are very friendly. The food is good with a limited choice but perfectly ok for a hotel of this size.One of the most striking things was that even in the height of the season the place never felt crowded and a sunbed was always available be it at 10am or 4pm which also stops the ridiculous towels on sunbeds at 6am routine found at a lot of other hotels!The hotel beach is nice with a bar and shower. There is no sand so a pair of beach shoes are a must, the stones are very hot!The hotel minibus is a very useful feature and a trip to the town and then on to Sweetwater Beach or Loutro is a lovely way to spend a day. We went on two of the hotels organised trips and thought they were really good, especially the West Coast boat trip.We can definately see ourselves returning at some point in the future!	5	223226116	Jul-14	South Coast

Staff are extremely nice and lovely. Rooms, public areas, buffet breakfast and dinner, services, cleanliness, programs, hospitality are fantastic. The food is excellent! There is a scheduled free of charge minibus to Filaki beach and Sfakia. Filaki is a lovely, romantic naturist beach with crystal clear blue water and many rocks.If you are stay at Vritomartis you will feel yourself as a member of a big family.It was our second stay.

We've been to many places in Greece the last 15 years, and I would put this hotel among the top three we have visited.This was our first trip to a naturist resort, and it strikes us how friendly the other guests were.  A really great week to think back upon when winter hits Norway.  We will return!(And in case you wonder: This is not a swinger hotel.  It appeared to be very family friendly.

	Ellinofil	326	221	One of the most relaxing places in the world	Reviewed 30 July 2014	We spent 8 very relaxing days at Vritomartis.The hotel is situated at a remote location, a 20-minute walk from Chora Sfakion. A few times a day a free bus to the village and to the nearby Filaki beach is provided.The hotel and all its premises are spotlessly clean, spacious and tastefully decorated. We had a large room with a nice modern bathroom, a large balcony, a small LCD TV and free A/C.All service is extremely professional, friendly and no-nonsense kind. We especially liked the bus driver and we were very impressed by the service of the waiters, especially Giannis, Kostas and Babis.The food is fantastic. You are spoiled for choice. After my regular morning joggings I was rewarded by the best breakfasts I have ever had in Greek hotels: a plethora of fresh fruit and vegetables, yoghurt, local cheeses, full English breakfast, oven baked tomato with wild herbs, muesli, toast, home baked bread, ... I was only disappointed by their fake orange juice â€“ Crete has so many cheap and extremely tasteful oranges and I am usually used to the natural juice.The dinners are unbelievable. I have never eaten so many perfect salads in my life. Not only they were prepared from fresh high quality vegetables, they were prepared in most innovative ways. You could choose anything from classical horiatiki, heavenly young spinach with oranges to sun ripe tomatos with pine nuts. The choice of main dishes was not as extensive; however, all of them were superb. Even the most basic ones were prepared in an innovative way. For example, perfectly baked chicken legs were served with subtle okra. Beside several traditional Greek dishes there was always a choice of international food. For example, their chicken curry was close to perfect. Even their pizza slices were wonderful. The sweets were fantastic. You could usually choose between fresh fruit, yoghurt and several Arabian-style delights.  The clientele is mostly older, very polite and everyone respects your privacy. Nudity is a non-issue.There is a large and very clean nudist pool with a mini bar which we never used.The nudist beach Filaki is about a 10-minute walk away. It is a nice large pebble beach and it provides a lot of privacy. Its east side cliff provides a pleasant natural shade for most of the day. There are several nice fantastic coves just a short walk away from the beach. Above the beach there is a small bar, owed by the hotel. We always rented two sunbeds and an umbrella and enjoyed the comfort; however, we thought that the price 7.5 EUR/day was unreasonably high considering that we were the guests of the hotel. Also, there is a substantial problem with the smokers. By some twisted logic they do not consider cigarette buds to be a distasteful waste and it always took more than a few minutes just to remove dozens of cigarette buds away from the sunbeds.The hotel offers several excursions. We went to Imbros gorge and loved the 2-hour walk down the gorge. We walked to the beach Glyka Nera and then to Loutro on our own and later returned by a boat to Chora Sfakion.Every night the hotel organizes some sort of evening entertainment, from traditional dances to karaoke. It seemed very pleasant and relaxed, but we rarely took part in it.In 8 days we were only able to use free wi-fi twice for less than 10 minutes. It seems to be a serious problem related to the poor internet connection in this remote part of Crete.After spending two weeks in Greece we wanted to wash our clothes. The hotel prices were unfortunately high. We would have to pay 2-4 EUR a piece (2 for a piece of underwear, 4 for a shirt) without ironing and we considered the price unacceptable. Later we found a cheap laundry in the village which washed and dried two large bags for 24 EUR. Bottom line: Vritomartis is a fantastic hotel which offers a high level of service, superb food and a very relaxing setting for determined nudist like us. We shall certainly return.	5	218375796	Jul-14	Ljubljana, Slovenia
	Cassie07	86	93	restfull	Reviewed 25 July 2014	After years of deliberating we finally decided to give Vritomartis a visit. What a pretty hotel it is. At first we were disappointed as our room had twin beds so we asked reception if we could change rooms. Unfortunately this was not possible as they were fully booked. However, they put a bed base  right next to one of the twin beds and made up a huge double for us. The rooms are large enough so we still had plenty of room to move around. So, tip 1, if you want a double bed ask when you book. Tip 2, if you get fed up with having to dress each time to go back to your hotel room book a bungalow. They are excellent and you can have all the freedom clothes wise you wish.  We looked out over the gardens and then to the sea  and, as the weather was very hot, had a shady terrace for a good part of the day.Dinner is served every night outside on the hotel terrace (you must be dressed) which is lovely. However, if, like me, you are vegetarian, you will find the choice limited. Plenty of salads but often with the usual problem of having tuna etc hidden in them! Usually one vegetarian hot dish but that will probably be all.We cannot praise the staff enough. they were all friendly and helpful. Housekeeping in particular work very hard to make sure your room/bathroom are spotless. The pool is crystal clear and all the common areas are excellent.We did, however, feel the hotel is remote. The nearest village, Hora Sfakion, is just a few kilometres up the road, very pretty  but they have very few shops, mostly bars, restaurants and a couple of hotels. However, you can catch boats from here each day to various other locations. Well worth doing.To sum up. Dont be put off by the drive across the mountain road. Its one of the better roads and holds no real problems. Do have a car and explore this beautiful island, there are some gems off the beaten track. If you want to really chill out, enjoy the wonderful Greek hospitality then this is the place. We would return but probably for fewer days, possibly after touring other parts of the island.	5	217423825	Jun-14	Rye, United Kingdom
	Alexander D	75	15	Super Holiday Hotel	Reviewed 25 July 2014	For the first time we had a naturist holiday. Booked via Internatuur, advised by an acquaintance.After a smooth flight we were brought by taxi to the hotel in a 1,5 hour night ride through the mountains. Because of the late hour we got a cold dinner, served with a smile.The next 14 days were a real surprise for us. We were treated like VIPs (all guest were) and service was given always with a smile.Because the hotel is situated in the south of Krete, you really need a car or scooter to see more of Krete if you want to. But also a (free!) busride to the nearby city is possible, or a free ride to the beach to the hotel. We even did some excursions. One to the gorge in the neigbourhood and a nudist excursion to some sometimes secluded beaches and a small town where we had lunch.But if you don't want to go and just want to stay at the hotel, the more then friendly staff is able to make your stay as comfortable as can be. You can have a lazy day at the pool, but aquagym is an option, or chess, shuffleboard, jeux de boules. Every evening animation.The room we had was simpel but sufficient, we only used it to sleep. (free airco)   We had the vacation of a lifetime here. We are sure going back some time!	5	217403301	Sep-13	Leidschendam, The Netherlands
	Ruth T	8	4	Superb first time intro to naturism.	Reviewed 23 July 2014	This was the very first naturism outing ever for my wife and only my second so we were a little apprehensive about the whole thing. Worry ye not because the people who run this family  resort know how to and the staff make sure that you feel very relaxed. We would like to thank the waiting staff, in particular Salomi and her partner Christos along with Ivana for their attention and Anna on reception. A special mention goes to Eva who taught me to fire arrows and play shuffle board! Eva works very hard in trying to make sure everyone has things to do and be entertained by. Good to see a mix of ages there too from children to OAPs. We had only one gripe and that was a very small one, we would have liked to have tea and coffee making facilities in the room.	5	217060282	Jul-14	Newport Pagnell, United Kingdom

	heatherjf1968	63	35	An absolutely wonderful, tranquil place.	Reviewed 19 July 2014	We've never been to Vritomartis before, but were unable to go to our usual holiday place. We thought we'd come here just for this year then return to the south of France from next year onwards. But no, we won't! This is an amazing place and we'll be alternating it with the South of France. To start from the beginning: we arrived at 2330 and thought there would be no chance of any dinner. However, some food had been kept for us and the other arrivals - so thoughtful. All the reception staff can't do enough to help.  We're staying (we're still here as we write!) in one of the bungalows, which is very well appointed and comfortable, with a balcony looking out to sea. When you book, if you want a double room, rather than a twin, it's worth asking for a double specifically, as some are twins. It's very useful having a small fridge in the room, which contained some complimentary fruit and drink on arrival.The next morning, a lovely buffet breakfast was served in the airy breakfast room. There is a great selection of hot and cold foods. The waiting staff are incredibly friendly and helpful and work so well together as a team. They all speak excellent English.  None of the public areas inside the hotel are naturist and mealtimes are also not naturist (although the very tasty evening meal is served on the terrace), so you'll need some clothes!During the day, a wealth of activities are laid on, both at the hotel and further afield. Eva, the events organiser, is very enthusiastic, friendly and helpful.  We had Greek lessons and took part in aquagym sessions.  There are also plenty of sunbeds and parasols around the very clean pool; proper wooden ones on the patio and moveable collapsible ones so you can pick a shady spot under the trees on the surrounding grass.  A complimentary minibus runs to the village and to the hotel's private beach. Don't be put off by the lack of sand; just take some wetshoes and you'll be fine. The sea is amazingly clear and warm and, thanks to the steep shelf, gets waist-height pleasingly quickly so you don't have to wade out before you can swim. There's a small coral reef right near the shore.  We snorkelled to the far side of it (about 15-20m) and were rewarded each day with seeing a real variety of inquisitive fish: it's like swimming in an aquarium!It's worth mentioning the grounds, which are immaculately maintained, including vegetable patches, by staff who appear to take real pride in what they do. As you walk through, any staff greet you with a cheerful, 'Kali mera'.  The rooms are also beautifully cleaned.This has been a brilliant holiday: you can get involved with activities as much as you want or just chill and enjoy the surroundings. What really makes it, though, is the staff team.(If you want to book the hotel as a package with flights from the UK and transfers, we came with Chalfont Holidays and highly recommend them.)	5	216250775	Jul-14	Thornton Heath, United Kingdom
